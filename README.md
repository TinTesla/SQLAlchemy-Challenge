# SQLAlchemy-Challenge
 Module 10

I found this module especially challenging. I still have a few lines that vary from the provided outputs, but I think it's still within the correct criteria. I did end up using ChatGPT to help with the last 2 functions. It took a few tries, but I think it did help me figure out what I needed and what was working. Only bug I couldn't figure out is that the API seems to have a runtime issue if you try searching the same query too soon after a previous query of the same search. Like if you refresh it right after searching, it comes up with the error message I came up with, even though it's still a valid query. Not sure if that's normal, just my PC, or if there's something wrong with my code.
